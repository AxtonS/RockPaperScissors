# RockPaperScissors
a simple game of rock, paper, scissors... joyous

This is my first little go at javascript.

During this project I learned how to play with scope and nesting various if statements and loops. 

Alternatively can use switch statements for readability, will change that when I revisit this project.

Second version I added an interactive UI but didn't change the actual game logic to a switch statement yet.

I learned how to add event listeners to html elements and push functions through them.

Currently:  

-"Beautify" the UI  
-Add function to input score limit
